# -Anagram-Grouping
Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in a different order.
 Explanation:
Each word is sorted alphabetically to form a key.

Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted form.

Use a HashMap to group all words by their sorted form.

Finally, collect all the grouped anagram lists.
